# PRE-REQUISITE(!) - YOU REALLY OUGHT TO DO THIS, MAKES THINGS MUCH SMOOTHER
# You need a valid DNS record pointing to pay.bitcoin-yhdistys.fi in order to be able to self-sign the certificate
# Add an A-record to your DNS service provider for your domain pointing to your IP

# Install git
sudo apt-get install git

# Login as root (You could probably do this non-sudo as well, but that would require tweaking with docker rights etc, etc... sudoing makes things way easier)
sudo su -

# Clone the btcpayserver docker repository
git clone https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver-docker
cd btcpayserver-docker

# Run btcpay-setup.sh with the right parameters
export BTCPAY_HOST="pay.bitcoin-yhdistys.fi"
export NBITCOIN_NETWORK="mainnet"
export BTCPAYGEN_CRYPTO1="btc"
export BTCPAYGEN_REVERSEPROXY="nginx"
export BTCPAYGEN_LIGHTNING="lnd"
export BTCPAY_ENABLE_SSH=true

# If disk space is an issue, include:
#export BTCPAYGEN_ADDITIONAL_FRAGMENTS="opt-save-storage-xs"

. ./btcpay-setup.sh -i

# DONE!

# Navigate your browser to https://pay.bitcoin-yhdistys.fi to setup admin and stores
